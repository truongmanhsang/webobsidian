# Changelog

All notable changes to WebObsidian are documented here. This project tracks its product
design and version history in [PRD.md](PRD.md); the entries below summarize user-facing
changes. The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Open-source repository scaffolding: `README.md` (with logo), `LICENSE` (MIT),
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, GitHub issue/PR templates and a
  CI workflow (typecheck, build, Docker image).
- File tree **Copy / Cut / Paste** for files and folders (session-local clipboard;
  `POST /api/files/copy` for recursive copy). *(PRD 0.9)*

### Changed
- ⋯ **More options** menu rebuilt for parity with Obsidian Desktop: backlinks-in-document,
  open linked view, open in new window, add file property, in-note Find, export to PDF,
  reveal file in navigation, and per-file version history. *(PRD 0.8)*

## Highlights by PRD revision

- **0.9** — File tree Copy/Cut/Paste; recursive copy endpoint.
- **0.8** — ⋯ menu parity with Obsidian Desktop; per-file Git version history (FR-4).
- **0.7** — Per-note **Share dialog** (create/copy/toggle/password/delete) + globe badge.
- **0.6** — Deploy hardening for self-hosting: all deploy params via `.env`, watcher polling
  fallback on inotify limits, longer healthcheck `start_period` (FR-9).
- **0.5** — Graph node search with smooth fly-to and highlighting (FR-2).
- **0.4** — Mobile / responsive UI: drawer sidebars, edge-swipe, on-keyboard formatting
  toolbar, touch targets, safe-area insets (FR-11).
- **0.3** — Per-pane ⋯ menu (split, bookmark, rename/move, etc.) and a redesigned right
  sidebar tab strip (Backlinks incl. unlinked mentions · Outgoing links · Tags · Outline).
- **0.2** — Deep-link URLs (`/note/...`), public read-only share links with central
  management, server-side rendering for SEO (FR-10).

## Core (v1 baseline)

- Obsidian-compatible vault (works on existing `.obsidian/` vaults).
- CodeMirror 6 editor with live/source/reading views; wikilinks, embeds, tags, callouts,
  tasks, KaTeX, Mermaid; backlinks, outline, graph view.
- QMD full-text + fielded search (MiniSearch), incremental indexing, disk persistence.
- GitHub sync (pull/commit/push) with Git LFS.
- Single master password login (scrypt + JWT cookie).
- Scoped Agent API at `/api/v1` with hashed API keys and rate limiting.
- Community-plugin loader against an Obsidian-API shim (subset).
- Pure-JSON config (`data/settings.json`); one-command Docker stack.
